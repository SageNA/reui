ReUI is a refactoring/restructing/rewrite of iUI.  It's purpose is to create a UI library that is compatible out of the box, for the most part, with iUI, and that is less intrusive that iUI.  

ReUI does not try to make any assumptions as to how your application functions.  It is more of a "transition" library than a full fledged application framework.

ReUI also includes some additional functionality:

* flip effect for transitions
* vertical transitions
* ability to define the effect/direction of the transition per page
* ability to show a page, without it being tracked in history

Currently ReUI is theme-compatible with iUI and includes the default iUI theme.
