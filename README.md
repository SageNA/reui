ReUI is a refactoring / rewrite of the iUI mobile UI framework, with a few additional features thrown in for good measure.

The goal of ReUI was to create a UI framework that is compatible, out of the box, with iUI based markup and styles, and one that is
less "strict" with how you want your application to function.  ReUI is more of a pure UI / navigation framework rather than a
full fledged application framework.

ReUI also includes some additional functionality:

* a flip transition effect
* full support for vertical transitions
* ability to define the effect and direction of the transition per page
* ability to show a page, without it being tracked in history

Currently ReUI is theme-compatible with iUI and includes the default iUI theme.
